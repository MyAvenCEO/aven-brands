 * island: nothing in those bands moves, so nothing hydrates and they ship
 * zero JavaScript. What remains Svelte in this file is exactly the part a
 * ViewDef cannot be yet:
 *
 *   - `MarketingSiteHeader` (the menu island lives inside it),
 *   - the skills preview GRID: `SkillMarketplaceCard` is shared with the
 *     marketplace page, and its accessible name carries a typographic dash
 *     the engine's attribute sanitiser would strip,
 *   - `AvenIdCheckCta`: real network logic, a future sandbox-tier island,
 *   - `SiteFooter`.
 *
 * All {@html} below renders our own build-rendered views and static copy
 * from $lib/i18n/home.ts — never user content.
